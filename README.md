# CleanBackend

CleanBackend is a practice project designed to explore clean code principles, Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Vertical Slices in backend API development. 

## About The Project

This project is built with C# using the .NET 6 and PostgreSQL for database operations. The goal is to provide a practical implementation and understanding of:

- **Clean Code:** Writing code that is easy to understand, read, and modify.
- **Clean Architecture:** An architecture that is independent of any particular framework, UI, database, or any external agency. It allows for testability and easy maintenance.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** An approach to software development that centers the project on the core domain and domain logic, maintaining a tight connection between the design and the business requirements.
- **Vertical Slices:** A type of software architecture that organizes features or functionalities into isolated slices, improving cohesion and reducing unnecessary dependencies.
